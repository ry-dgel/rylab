    Parameters
    ----------
    xs : [number]
        The values to convert into a single mean with uncertainty.
    weights : [number], optional
        The weights to be considered for each x value when averaging

        The unit of the value and uncertainty to pass to gummy, by default None

    gummy
        The gummy object containing the mean and uncertainty.
